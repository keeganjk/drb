# drb

Read the Douay-Rheims Bible and other Catholic doctrinal texts directly from your terminal.

The following texts are included:
- [Douay-Rheims Bible, Challoner Revision](https://www.ccel.org/c/challoner/douayrheims/dr.html)
- [Catechism of the Catholic Church](http://www.vatican.va/archive/ENG0015/_INDEX.HTM)
- [Code of Canon Law](http://www.vatican.va/archive/cod-iuris-canonici/cic_index_en.html)
- [Code of Canons of Oriental Churches](http://www.jgray.org/codes/cceo90eng.html)
- [General Instruction of the Roman Missal](http://www.vatican.va/roman_curia/congregations/ccdds/documents/rc_con_ccdds_doc_20030317_ordinamento-messale_en.html)

The texts were machine parsed from the above sources, and while they were partially manually verified, some errors may be present, so *caveat utilitor*.
Efforts have been taken to preserve footnotes and references where possible; these extratextual annotations are surrounded by square brackets (`[]`).
